Hydra/Inferno
=============

What is Hydra/Inferno?
----------------------
  Hydra/Inferno is an operating system/kernel written from scratch by 
  Ariston Lorenzo, Levi Hicks, and other developers.  The project aims 
  towards UNIX/POSIX compliance.

  We aim to have what you'd expect in a usual Unix system like multitasking,
  virtual memory, shared libraries, good memory management, etc..

What hardware can it run on?
----------------------------
  As of v0.1, Inferno targets x86_64 with future plans to target ARM64.
  32-bit architectures aren't planned for later releases.

  We do accept 32-bit related patches but they will not be maintained by
  Ariston or Levi.

How can I contribute?
---------------------
  We accept any useful patches whether they are coding style fixes, small
  changes, or even new drivers, features, etc.. For more info on how to
  contribute, see docs/contributing for more info.
