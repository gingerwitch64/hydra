## About
Echo, originally started as Hydra, is a Operating System built in C++ built on top of the
custom Inferno kernel. It is made for ARM64 and x64 UEFI Machines.
This repository has 3 main sections, BOB (our bootloader), Inferno (the kernel), and Echo
(the operating system itself).
<!-- TODO: Work on expanding this section. To me (Thomas Lim), it doesn't look that descriptive. -->
